Speech generation using GAN (work in progress)
===

Current code is in PyTorch, and only the following files are relevant.
* `audiogan.py`
* `dataset.py`
* `timer.py`
* `preprocess-fisher.py` for preprocessing the Fisher English Training corpus.

Other files are obsolete and they are only kept for references (we used WGAN-GP
before but we reverted to classical GAN now).
